# CodeIgniter 4 Advanced Application Starter

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project denis303/codeigniter-advanced-app` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

1. Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

2. Run `bower install` or extract `public_libs.zip` archive.
